<h2 align="center"> Choosing Dependencies </h2>
<p>After deciding what type of application we wanted to build, the next step was to decide what dependencies we wanted to use to facilitate the process. There are many libraries to choose from and therefore we had to do our due dilligence and research which ones would better serve our needs. Our main research hub was the NPM website where all the packages we used have readmes with all the information we need to know about it.
</p>

<h2 align="center"> About Task </h2>
<p>

</p>
<h3> Server Side </h3>
<p>
In order to set up our back end, we had to start by installing the necessary dependencies.
As stated previously, we chose Express to be our server, Mongo our database and Mongoose to be our ODM. We have Mongo installed goblally on our machines so we only had to install express and mongoose to initate our back-end.
     
```
npm install express
```

```
npm install mongoose
```
     
Once those were installed. The first step was to set up our server and make sure the assigned port was listening. Right after we set up our database and connected Mongoose as well.
</p>

<p>
<h2 align="center">Models</h2>

For our MERN Store we had set up four models:

* Account

* transaction

<h4 align="center">Account </h4>
Here create new account of user, where bank take some information of user like name, email, address, amount, account type, city.


<h4 align="center">Transaction </h4>
this model contain all transaction form  one account to another account

<h2 align="center">Express and Routes</h2>
Once the server and the models were set up, we were able to start working on our first routes that would facilitate the communication between User input and Database actions.


<h2 align="center">Bootstrap</h2>

For our UI we decided to go with a react-bootstrap package.
